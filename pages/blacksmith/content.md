Static is good
--------------

Some of you can ask themselves why use static files in 2012?   
In fact, static files have some great advantages:

- This site can be hosted everywhere.
- This site is very fast.
- It is really simple to administrate.

So for all these reasons and also because Blacksmith is quite easy to customize, I choose this solution.   
This blog has some fixes which are not in the master branch of Blacksmith for the moment. These fixes are:

- ToC exceptions.
- ToC HTML structure fix.
- ToC content fix.

But there are all available in [my Blacksmith branch](https://github.com/lfont/blacksmith).   

EDIT: I found a bug with the restitution of the doctype in Blacksmith. I have [a quick and dirty fix](https://github.com/lfont/blacksmith/tree/fix-doctype) that force the HTML 5 doctype. I will push a better fix in a near future.
