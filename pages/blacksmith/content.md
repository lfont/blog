Static is good
--------------

Some of you can ask themself why use static files in 2012?   
In fact, static files have some great advantages:

- This site can be hosted everywhere.
- This site is very fast.
- It is really simple to administrate.

So for all these reasons and also because Blacksmith is quite easy to customize made me choose this solution.   
This blog has some fixes that are not in the master branch of Blacksmith for the moment:

- ToC exceptions.
- ToC HTML structure fix.
- ToC content fix.

But all these fixes are available in my [Blacksmith branch](https://github.com/lfont/blacksmith).
