</p>
<h2>Static is good</h2>
<p>Some of you can ask themselves why use static files in 2012?<br />In fact, static files have some great advantages:

</p>
<ul>
<li>This site can be hosted everywhere.</li>
<li>This site is very fast.</li>
<li>It is really simple to administrate.</li>
</ul>
<p>So for all these reasons and also because Blacksmith is quite easy to customize, I choose this solution.<br />This blog has some fixes which are not in the master branch of Blacksmith for the moment. These fixes are:

</p>
<ul>
<li>ToC exceptions.</li>
<li>ToC HTML structure fix.</li>
<li>ToC content fix.</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are all available in <a href="https://github.com/lfont/blacksmith">my Blacksmith branch</a>.   

</p>
<p>EDIT: I found a bug with the restitution of the doctype in Blacksmith. I have <a href="https://github.com/lfont/blacksmith/tree/fix-doctype">a quick and dirty fix</a> that force the HTML 5 doctype. I will push a better fix in a near future.</p>

</p>
<p>This is my first post on my brand new blog. There is nothing really interesting to learn here.<br />Except the fact that this blog is going to be the place where I talk about my work and the stuff that make my working days fun.</p>
